        <h3> A Plant-Powered Hero! </h3>

        <p>As you may have seen, traces of climate change are everywhere: striking numbers of heatwaves, droughts, typhoons, and hurricanes. Our ecosystems are threatened, and we are in a planetary crisis.</p>

        <p>Surging greenhouse gases from energy, agriculture and industrial sectors are the key drivers of climate change. Carbon dioxide catches the world attention as it accounts for three-fourth of the global greenhouse emissions.</p>

        <p>While there are encouraging developments to slash carbon footprint, they are rather time-consuming, complicated and expensive, and thus more or less suitable for climate change long-term solutions.</p>

        <p>There is a simpler, more effective and immediate solution: to tackle methane. This is the second largest greenhouse source that responsible for 40% of global warming since the industrial revolution. 
            It is likewise much more dangerous than carbon dioxide, but lasts considerably shorter in the atmosphere.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Majority of methane is from agriculture activities, particularly farming of livestock or fishes. Besides, its end-products such as meat, egg and dairy also associate with huge nitrous oxide emission.</p>
        <p>Hence, our solution is simple: by switching to plant-based diet, we can immediately save the 
            Earth. There are so many healthy, cost-effective and sustainable plant-based options out there. Everyone can and have the power to be our own hero for this magnificent planet!</p>

        <p>By wisely selecting this great lifestyle, you will not only cut more than 90% of greenhouse gas emission, but also preserve so much water, land and energy! 
        These precious resources can be for other uses, such as planting trees to absorb more greenhouse gases, or building solar/wind farms to replace polluted fossil-fuel plants.</p>

        <p>There are many other awesome benefits of plant-based diet, but I will leave them for your own curiosity and self-exploration.</p> 
        <p>Deep down, I am 3,000% sure that by switching to vegan, you will be much happier, by knowing that this small action is the greatest choice that you have ever made, 
            not only for our beautiful planet, but also for your personal gain, for the sake of innumerable loving animal-people, as well as for our countless future generations.</p>
